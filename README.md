Personal Finance Manager
 This project is a RESTful API  that allows users to manage their finances effectively. The application will include features for creating budgets, tracking transactions, managing financial goals, categorizing expenses, and generating financial insights. The project should live in its own GitHub repository, with a detailed README.md file to guide setup and deployment. It's built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB,Typescript. 

Additionally, there are optional bonus challenges, including implementing autogenerated categories for transactions, generating reports, and including an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) among the solution files.

Project Overview
The Personal Finance Manager provides a robust API for managing users and their finances effectively. User authentication is implemented with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and each route is protected accordingly. A welcome email is sent to new users upon registration using EJS templating. Environment variables store sensitive information for enhanced security.

Project Folder Descriptions

Controllers:
Functions responsible for handling the logic of API requests.

Models:
MongoDB schemas and models used to define the data structure for database collections.

Routes:
Defines API endpoints that map client requests to specific controllers.
e.g. Authentication Routes: Endpoints for user signup, login, and logout.

Views:
EJS templates used for server-side rendering or dynamic emails.
- Welcome Email Template: The HTML structure for the welcome email sent to users upon successful registration.

Environment Variables:
Configuration settings stored in a `.env` file to manage sensitive information securely.
- Database Connection String: Specifies the URL for connecting to the MongoDB instance.
- JWT Secret Key: Secret key for signing and verifying JWT tokens.
- Server Port: Defines the port the server listens on.
- Email Service Configuration: Credentials and settings for sending emails via an SMTP server.

Middlewares:
Custom functions to handle tasks such as:
- Authentication and authorization for protected routes.
- Logging requests and responses.
- Validating incoming request bodies and query parameters.
- Error Handling: Centralized functions to format and manage errors consistently.

Utils:
Reusable helper functions such as:
- Password Hashing: Hash user passwords securely.
- Token Generation: Create and verify JWT tokens.

Validation:
Schema definitions for validating request payloads using libraries like `Joi` or `Zod`.
eg User Validation: Ensure email, password, and profile details meet specified criteria.


Ensure to set up the following environment variables for the application:

PORT: Port for the server (default: 3000).
JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT token generation.
DB_URI: MongoDB connection string.
EMAIL_HOST: SMTP server host.
EMAIL_PORT: SMTP server port.
EMAIL_USER: SMTP username.
EMAIL_PASS: SMTP password.
Database Setup
Database: This project uses MongoDB. You can set up a MongoDB instance on MongoDB Atlas or run a local MongoDB server.
Connection URI: Update the DB_URI environment variable in .env with your MongoDB connection URI.
Postman Documentation
The API documentation, grouped by functionality, is available as a Postman collection:

Endpoints:
User Authentication: /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, api/auth/logout


Authorization: Demonstrates JWT-based authorization for protected routes.
Environment Setup: A Postman environment setup with common variables (base_url, auth_token) for easy testing.
